% the abstract 
{This report describes the construction and development of an embedded system used to sort LEGO bricks.
The specifications---which it is sorting by---will be focused on the size and colour of bricks; initially it will only handle rectangular bricks without holes.
The constructed system consists of a conveyor belt with two sensors, one for size and one for colour detection, and runs on an \textit{Arduino Mega 2560}.
To find the time the system takes sorting bricks on an average case, a simulation is run using \textit{UPPAAL}.}
